# Fresco Retail Product Return Prediction and Analytics App

### Project Overview

- This project analyzes product returns for a retail company (Fresco Retailer).
It aims to understand factors influencing returns and provide actionable insights to reduce return rates.

### Key Objectives:

1- Identify patterns in customer returns.

2- Examine the impact of payment methods, store types, income levels, product categories, reviews, and tax levels.

3- Provide strategic recommendations to improve customer satisfaction and reduce returns.

Project Steps / Workflow

### Approach & Steps:

1️⃣ Data Cleaning
I started with a complete data cleaning process: checking missing values, fixing data types, and removing duplicates — until the dataset was clean and ready for analysis and ML.

2️⃣ Univariate Analysis
I went through each column individually to identify any issues, studied distributions, checked outliers, and performed EDA to gain a deeper understanding of every feature.

3️⃣ Detailed Exploratory Analysis (Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis)
I explored relationships between variables, which helped me identify valuable patterns such as:
– which product categories have the highest return rates
– which customer segments tend to return items more
– how different features like taxes, rating, payment method, and price affect return probability

From this analysis, I generated strong insights and created clear recommendations for the business based on data-driven patterns.

4️⃣ Feature Engineering
I created new features that improved the model’s ability to capture hidden patterns.
I also used a Correlation Matrix + ExtraTreesClassifier to identify the most important features and remove weak ones.

5️⃣ ML Pipelines
I built clean and automated ML pipelines for both numerical and categorical data — including encoding, scaling, and handling class imbalance — all without any data leakage.

6️⃣ Model Training & Tuning
I trained multiple models using full cross-validation to choose the best one and then applied hyperparameter tuning.
XGBoost turned out to be the most stable and best-performing model.

Final Model Results after tuning:
• Train Accuracy: 0.9784
• Test Accuracy: 0.9755
• Train Recall: 0.8917
• Test Recall: 0.8793
• Train Precision: 0.9015
• Test Precision: 0.8867

7️⃣ Deployment
I deployed the model using Streamlit, allowing users to input new order details and instantly get a prediction on whether the product is likely to be returned.
I also added an Analytics & Insights page, where users can view all the analysis, insights, and final recommendations extracted from the data.
